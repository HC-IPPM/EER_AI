N22-01,"The Task Force needs to make sure that experts in the specific area continue to be removed from the voting process on final recommendations. This is supported by research demonstrating that higher focus in specific brings biases more than generalism. Also, primary care providers implement these guidelines, do virtually all the preventive care of the Task Force, and thus are best at balancing the complex risks and benefits screening. It is essential they lead the guideline process. That said, we also need to find ways to include specialized colleagues in consultation to process. Unfortunately, the dialogue between the Task Force leadership and those with differing views digressed to dispute and negative communication. The Task Force has spent too much effort asserting the superiority of their methods and lack of bias, instead of seeking common ground. Part of that narrative has led the Task Force to lean into being more and more focused on GRADE, complex detailed systematic reviews, and formal process, instead of looking at collaborations. There is an arrogance in the Task Force that is hurting it. This is a cycle that feeds on itself. The focus of future leadership should be authenticity, listening, collaboration, and inclusivity.","As mentioned, it should remain focused and led by primary care but needs to have collaboration and inclusivity with specialist and special interest groups. It needs leadership keen on collaboration. Our speciality colleagues also have to accept that realities of primary care are different, time/dollars are not infinite resources, and patient choice is paramount. For example, the US Task Force does not consider time and resource needed for an intervention, which has led them to recommend so many things it is no estimated a primary care provider would need >24 hours per day to follow their (and other) recommendations. Canada truly has the best balance of this right now. I would suggest that specialized voices be included but the voting must be managed (due to bias) but they should be given time to be heard (and they need to understand/accept realities of primary care) and they should be authors on the guideline (not just acknowledged).","The Task Force was starting on the equity and disparities work but this could be expanded. They should reach out to groups before the guideline starts. As to subject matter experts, advice given above.",,
N24-01,"The strong representation of family doctors should be maintained since they constitute the main actors having to “implement” the recommendations with their patients. Patients, public health experts, shared decision experts as well as health economists should complete the team. The addition of economists aims to maintain a safeguard protecting the health system from costs, in human or financial resources, which would be unsustainable for the system. Recommendations that are not aligned with available resources contribute to weakening the system, particularly its universality, which, in turn, is very harmful to everyone's health.","Analysis of the data in the literature translated into decision support tools as well as a systemic evaluation of recommendations should be the ultimate goal of all stakeholders. It is dangerous to see diseases in isolation. It would be a mistake to think only of breast cancer and its mortality without taking into account the psychological impact of a false positive in a context of shortage of mental health resources.
The study group must therefore listen to stakeholders but remain sovereign, in collaboration with public health actors, in order to produce guidelines that are applicable, sustainable, global and patient-centered (or shared decision)","Collaborations aimed at equity should be favoured. Once again, the integration of health economists and application projections are key to ensuring that the recommendation is realistic, applicable and sustainable.
Expert opinion in the area should not replace evidence-based medicine. Experts could help to ensure that all literature considered is the correct one. Nevertheless, when it comes to prevention and screening, it is frontline and public health professionals who are the experts. Experts in a given clinical condition are experts in the condition, not in its detection or prevention.",,
N24-02,"Practices to Maintain: Evidence-Based Methodology: The Task Force’s reliance on rigorous systematic reviews ensures scientifically grounded guidelines. This approach must remain the foundation for decision-making.
Transparency in Processes: Public access to methodologies, decision-making rationales, and conflict-of-interest disclosures fosters trust and accountability. Continued publication of these materials is essential.
Multidisciplinary Input: Inclusion of diverse subject-matter experts enhances relevance and Inclusivity. Maintaining this approach will support comprehensive and evidence-informed guidelines.
Independence from External Pressures, maintaining independence from political and industrial influences safeguards the credibility of the guidelines.
Proposed Enhancements:
Expanded Governance Structures: Include advisory panels focused on equity, Indigenous health, and patient representation. Diversify leadership and membership of the Task Force to reflect Canada’s regional, cultural, and professional diversity.
Transparency in Development: Host public consultations and webinars during guideline drafting phases to incorporate broader feedback.Publish annual reports on progress, gaps, and future priorities.
Enhanced Agility: Establish rapid response teams for emerging health issues (e.g., pandemics, climate change impacts on health).
Integration of MSK Health as a Priority Area: Recognize MSK health as a cornerstone of preventive care, addressing its links to chronic diseases such as mental health disorders, cardiovascular conditions, and metabolic syndromes.
Current gaps in preventive strategies, early detection, and treatment for MSK health demand comprehensive integration into the Task Force’s mandate. The holistic nature of MSK care—spanning primary prevention, early diagnosis, and evidence-based treatments by chiropractors, physiotherapists, and other professionals—makes it a model for enhancing the Task Force’s transparency, collaboration, and leadership.","The future mandate of the Task Force must reflect the interconnected nature of health systems and the evolving priorities of preventive health care. This includes strengthening partnerships and addressing areas such as MSK health, which have profound implications for chronic disease prevention and management.
Refined Mandate: Broader Scope of Preventive Care:
Expand the mandate to address MSK health explicitly, recognizing its role in preventing chronic diseases and enhancing quality of life.
Integrate social determinants of health, mental health, and environmental factors into preventive health guidelines.
Equity-Driven Prioritization: Focus on interventions addressing health disparities in underserved and equity-deserving populations.
Implementation Science: Emphasize research-to-practice translation to ensure guidelines are actionable and practical for diverse settings.
Opportunities for Collaboration: National Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations like the Canadian Chiropractic Association, Canadian Chiropractic Guideline Initiative, and Physiotherapy Association to leverage MSK expertise.
Partner with provincial and territorial health authorities to ensure regional adaptability of guidelines.
International Cooperation: Engage with global bodies such as the World Health Organization to harmonize methodologies and share best practices.
Cross-Sectoral Alliances: Work with community organizations and educational institutions to promote guideline awareness and implementation.
Integration with Chronic Disease Programs: Embed MSK health into existing chronic disease prevention frameworks, highlighting its role in reducing cardiovascular, metabolic, and mental health risks.","Strategies for Strengthening Engagement: Equity Advisory Panels:
Establish panels with representatives from Indigenous, racialized, and marginalized communities to co-develop guidelines.
Public Consultations and Feedback Mechanisms: Host community forums, focus groups, and online surveys to gather input from diverse populations.
Accessible Communication: Translate guidelines into multiple languages and use plain language summaries to reach all Canadians.
Community Partnerships: Work with grassroots organizations to tailor guidelines to local contexts and disseminate them effectively.
Training and Mentorship: Build capacity among underrepresented professionals, ensuring their voices contribute to guideline development.
Evaluation Metrics: Develop and publish metrics to track the inclusivity of engagement efforts and their impact on guideline adoption.
Co-developing MSK health interventions with Indigenous and underserved communities—integrating traditional healing practices and evidence-based treatments—can reduce cultural and access barriers while improving health outcomes.
Action Plan for Musculoskeletal (MSK) Health: Integration into the Task Force Framework
MSK health is a prime candidate for integration into the Task Force’s priorities, given its preventive potential and relevance across the lifespan.
Prevention Strategies: Launch awareness campaigns on MSK health, posture, and physical activity. Implement school and workplace programs promoting ergonomics and movement.
Early Detection and Diagnosis: Incorporate routine MSK screenings into primary care.
Leverage digital tools for self-assessment and remote consultations.
Evidence-Based Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care: Develop integrated treatment plans involving chiropractic care, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and medical management. Expand non-pharmacological pain management options.
Equity and Accessibility: Co-develop culturally sensitive MSK care programs with equity-deserving communities. Use telemedicine and mobile clinics to improve access in rural areas.
Research and Innovation: Fund studies on MSK health’s role in chronic disease prevention.
Build national data registries to inform policy and practice.
Stakeholder Engagement: Foster interprofessional collaboration across healthcare disciplines.
Develop tools for public empowerment in self-managing MSK health.",,
N24-03,"I see no major issues with transparency, accountability, independence or scientific rigor. Changes are needed to improve the timeliness of guideline updating and the production of new guidelines. Several factors influence this. One is the speed with which PHAC staff and Task Force (TF) members work. With respect to the TF members, a lack of speed may be expected due to volunteer status. From the 2022 PHAC review: “The lack of compensation has also limited the amount of time members can devote to Task Force activities, affecting overall timeliness.”
Regarding PHAC staff, I do have concerns about some members of the Science Team. These are talented people who are too often called away to attend to non-TF matters. But progress is possible. For example, in years past I witnessed the PHAC Science Team being overly involved in the systematic reviews that are fundamentally an ERSC responsibility. In response to the 2022 internal review that pointed to a need to “Clarify PHAC’s role versus that of the ERSCs with respect to scoping and conducting systematic reviews”: I believe the ERSC is now taking the lead on scoping the literature for each proposed guideline in addition to conducting the systematic reviews.","I do not see a compelling need to change the mandate of the TF. Nationally, the TF collaborates with Choosing Wisely Canada and the PEER group based in Alberta. We work with all manner of clinical experts. For example, a member of Osteoporosis Canada acted as a clinical expert advsing the 2023 guideline panel on preventing fragility fractures.
Internationally, the most obvious parties for collaboration would be the UK National Screening Committee and the US Preventive Services Task Force. In their work, the US Task Force is supported by evidence review centres via the Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality (AHRQ). In 2021, I was unsuccessful in trying to obtain systematic review data for a proposed new guideline on the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Put simply, AHRQ would not share the data for their review of this topic.
Prior to my term as co-chair, Dr Thombs attempted to establish collaborations with the UK National Screening Committee on systematic reviews of topics of shared interest. But this effort did not bear fruit for reasons I cannot recall.","As a societal problem, the complex and multifactorial solutions to address disparities in health equity fall outside the sphere of influence of the Canadian TF.
Regarding ‘subject-matter experts’, strengthening the engagement of such people in TF guidelines might paradoxically be problematic. First, let us agree that a subject-matter expert is a person who has accumulated knowledge in a particular field or topic (such as a specific disease or set of diseases), as demonstrated by their degree, licensure, and/or through years of professional experience. Over time, such experts often develop conflicts of interest, whether intellectual or financial in nature. Jatoi and Sah (CMAJ 2019) compared clinical practice guidelines from specialty societies against guideline recommendations produced by panels independent of a particular specialty. They found that specialty societies recommended more health care interventions linked to their specialty. This lends support for a recommendation from Ioannidis that guideline panels for primary health care be multidisciplinary with disease experts serving as consultants, not voting members. I am sympathetic to this position as articulated in his 2018 article in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.
Finally, I would like to state the following. As a family doctor, the TF provided me an opportunity to meaningfully contribute to medical knowledge through guideline recommendations for screening and preventive health care. In this respect, the TF is arguably the only such option available to Family Physicians in Canada.",,
N25-01,"In order for the recommendations to remain relevant as a whole, it is imperative to include partners who have no affiliation with the pharmaceutical industry. Include only evidence based on literature and not on expert opinions. Include groups specializing in the analysis of relevance.","The mandate of the expert group should be to provide clinicians with recommendations that include data such as “number needed to treat” or “number of screenings necessary for a positive outcome” BUT ALSO, the “number needed to harm”, or the number of negative effects associated with screenings. This is essential for clinicians and patients to make informed decisions.

It is also necessary to include opportunity costs in the analysis: i.e. when a multitude of patients undergo radiological screening even though they are at low risk of the disease: they take the imaging appointment slot of a another patient more at risk who will then have increased diagnosis times, which will have a real impact on their outcome….

Furthermore, in order to incorporate the notions of social justice and planetary health (i.e. there are no healthy humans if the environment in which they are is not healthy and we also know that the most marginalized groups experience the repercussions of pollution the most): it is imperative to include the environmental burden linked to screening tests in the calculations of the “number needed to harm”…as well as the economic burden ( We remember that the $ invested in health is not invested in education, social services and the environment which are major determinants for the development of human health and the quality of life in our society….). It is therefore essential that the recommendations include all these facets in the expert group's analysis.",N/A,,
N28-01,"The fact that members of the TF are volunteers is not a sustainable practice and limits the pool of those who apply and participate. This probably also limits the time that individuals can volunteer to the process and would impact ability to update guidelines in a timely manner.
The practice of TF chair selecting members means that ideological similarly individuals are concentrated within the TF. Members should be vetted by an external body.
Sufficiently resource evidence reviews, guideline updates, and responsiveness to emerging research. This is an investment in saved downstream healthcare costs.
Consider putting less weight on “values and preferences” studies as values and preferences are extremely individualised which must be determined by each person for themselves in the context of appropriate individualised risk/benefit information.
Have a justifiable process for choosing “thresholds” to recommend screening. Ensure these are consistent across all guidelines.
There must be appreciation for differing ways to present risk/benefits for health interventions. A focus on absolute numbers constrains the ability to individualise risks and benefits.
Guidelines must be updated a minimum every 5 years, or sooner if an influential trial changes practice.
The impact of guidelines must be assessed in an ongoing manner.
Subject matter experts must be involved in every step of the process, and their involvement must be meaningful and not just a sign-off of completed guidelines. By having non-specialists dictating terms of breast cancer screening review, over-emphasis was placed on old data as there was an incomplete appreciation for the evolution of breast cancer treatment and its impacts on survival and mortality.
Do not require guideline members to sign confidential agreements. Allow guideline members to remove their name from the final guideline report if they are not in agreement with the guidelines. Currently, few individuals will agree to review guidelines, because their name will be irrevocably attached to the guideline, even if they do not agree.
Experts should be voting members.
Appreciate that guidelines must be a collaborative effort between specialists who typically can understand and interpret the evidence within their fields, and FPs who typically must enact the contents of the guidelines. Content expertise does not equal bias.
Consider housing a future version of the TF within an institution such as the CMA, which reflects both specialist and primary care interests.
Ensure an accountability structure that includes reporting requirements of the TF to funders, CFPC and the Royal College.
The TF should not dictate the terms of the evidence review, as guidelines become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Evidence collection should not be siloed within different institutions as this limits the ability to have crosstalk and learning across different questions.
Currently the TF pays the evidence review teams, and even pays for publishing costs for evidence review manuscripts. This must be independent.
Evidence review teams MUST contain content experts to allow for appropriate interpretation. For example, with the breast KQ1 review, mastectomy was used as a measure of morbidity (i.e. as opposed to lumpectomy) even though this was the only surgical option for breast cancer at the time the trials were done, and so actually represented treatment of breast cancer.
The TF should not have any ownership or say over manuscripts produced by evidence review team. Currently evidence review manuscripts must be approved by TF, and publication is funded by TF.
In terms of the evidence base, the TF must be open-minded and consider EBM-plus principles:
Old trials which do not reflect current medical practices should be “sunsetted.”
-It is unlikely that there will be many more RCTs on basic screening questions as:
1) they are too expensive
2) It can take 10-20 years for appropriate follow up for mortality endpoints
3) RCTs typically do not reflect the heterogeneity of our Canadian society.
3) It is unethical to withhold screening in a control arm when mortality benefit has been shown for screening
We must therefore consider new and different types of evidence: observational and ecological, modelling and “big data” from our cancer registry and not automatically downgrade this evidence.
-we should validate endpoints for benefit beyond mortality, such as cancer stage and interval cancers to allow more timely use of evidence.
-we should use our cancer registry data and other health system databases to inform guidelines. However, in order to be able to do this we need significant investment in provincial and national registry data. Our current cancer registry has significant limitations in terms of timeliness, completeness of data and extent of data available.
-modelling should be used, but models MUST have clinical experts embedded in their development, updating and use. The recent OncoSim economic update does not seem to have included a breast oncologist and has very different costs than those determined by those with specialist input.","Currently the TF is divisive, minimizes interventions and takes a paternalistic tone, removing patient autonomy. It has driven provincial differences in screening guidelines leading to health inequities across our country.
What deserves a guideline? If there are too many guidelines, none will be followed. Conditions must be common enough that it makes sense to have a guideline. Focus should be on primary and secondary prevention. Some of the TF current guidelines focus on topics for which there was very little evidence available to make an informed decision “i.e. Esophageal Adenocarcinoma”. The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
Guidelines currently in Canada seem to have a bias towards minimising interventions. Some TF members have links with Choosing Wisely, which can drive nihilistic medicine. Clearly, more is not always better, but there are complex calculi behind any decision to do or not do something, the nuances of which cannot always be captured with current TF processes.
PCPs feel “over -guidelined” and with so many guidelines, find they are unable to keep up with them all and tend to ignore subsequent iterations.
Worse still, each topic currently has multiple guidelines from multiple specialities and organisations. i.e. osteoporosis, diabetes. With each guideline being slightly different, PCPs end up not following any of them and continuing to do what they have always done. We cannot have multiple guidelines from specialities, FP and other organisations. There must be single harmonised national guidelines with sections addressing primary care, specialist care and patients.
The current discrepancies between guidelines drive care which is not congruent with guidelines and also drives provincial differences in practices.
Economic analyses must be part of any guideline. Effective economic analyses must include clinicians who are up to date on all current aspects of treating the condition in question and must be updated regularly. Especially for cancer, costs change exponentially in the space of a few years with rapid innovations.D8","Guideline development must be a collaborative process including relevant representatives from specialist and generalist fields and organisations.
Patients cannot be expected to meaningfully participate without adequate preparation. There should be education sessions available for patients and community members who wish to be involved so that they can understand basic principles of evidence-based medicine and contribute productively.
Engage relevant patient advocacy groups.
Ensure patrnership with typically underserved groups to increase uptake and accesiblity and enable health equity.
Guidelines should remove barriers. Currently where discussions are mandated with PCP, guidelines create barriers, especially for equity deserving populations who are less likely to self-advocate.",,
N28-02,"I feel that the scientific rigor, transparency and independence of the work they do is clear and well communicated on their website. I don't feel I can always say the same thing of many other expert guideline groups in Canada and indeed internationally. This must be encouraged to continue. If any criticism can be made, I feel the task force should be better supported financially and with administrative back-up such that they can produce more of this work faster. We wait a long time for new updates, for example it is 10 years since any updates to prostate (2014) and cervical (2013) guidelines have been published and this leaves the task force open to criticism that they are not up to date. Various interested parties, which may not be so independent, can inject confusion into the media and patients can be left questioning our advice. Provincial guidelines sometimes fill that void but they lack the broad scope of the Task Force and often will not provide the same guidance as each other, this leads to confusion for patients and as an educator trying to train learners to work anywhere in Canada this is challenging. The Task Force provides clear, evidence based national guidance to help guide us, our learners and therefore our patients and provide better care.","We are acutely aware in Primary Care of the evidence around the ""time needed to treat"" (https://www.bmj.com/content/380/bmj-2022-072953) and when guidelines are not considering the impact of their recommendations on access to care, equitable care and that simply making recommendations to encourage certain maneuvers isn't really adding value (one example would be bone density in all older men when we know there will be few who would need/accept/benefit from treatment). Our national clinical guidelines should be crafted in conjunction with other non-biased groups and organizations who have deservedly earned and maintained the respect of their professional colleagues. I would highlight the work of Choosing Wisely Canada and PEER for example in giving valuable guidance on primary care provision by primary care. Close collaboration with the Task Force on a shared remit of providing high value primary care with these groups moving forward should be encouraged in my view. ","My understanding is that as things stand, expert input is actively solicited by the Task Force when reviewing evidence. Interested parties are welcome to submit data and other research to ensure that all voices are heard and all evidence relevant to the clinical question is available. When guidelines are drafted an opportunity is presented for further input and discussion before recommendations are finalized. I also understand that with patient partnered care in mind, patients are part of the work of the task force and I would certainly feel that this is an area for growth in particular to ensure that underserved populations and racial minorities are represented adequately so I can have clearer evidence to advise these folks on whether these guidelines apply to them or when they are at different risk. These remain guidelines not rules and for example if a 39 year old lady in my care is concerned about breast cancer we can have an informed discussion and arrange imaging if that is her preference, I feel the media miss this piece when reporting on some of this to the general public. More support for media training and engagement with the Task Force to ensure Government, other stakeholders and most importantly patients understand this work is needed to prevent misunderstanding.
I am pleased that a clear review of the remit and support available to the Task Force is being completed and grateful for the opportunity to submit this commentary. I would be more than happy to be contacted by the committee if any clarification of further information on any of the above would be helpful.",,
N28-03,"The CTFPHC demonstrates exemplary transparency and essential rigor in its processes, notably through the central role played by front-line clinicians, particularly family physicians, in drafting guidelines, which ensures their relevance and applicability. 
Systematic reliance on rigorous evidence, through transparent systematic reviews, ensures that every recommendation is based on solid evidence. 
The rigorous management of conflicts of interest within CTFPHC safeguards the group's independence and credibility. To this end, I would like to draw the attention of the members of the committee responsible for the external review exercise to the fact that conflicts of interest can be both commercial, but also of an intellectual nature. If experts are to have the opportunity to express their views and contribute to the process of drafting the guidelines, I am convinced of the importance of clearly defining their place within the CTFPHC. 
The position of specialists (or experts) in the continuum of care exposes them primarily to severe or advanced forms of certain pathologies, which can lead to a bias in the representation of these diseases. It is therefore natural that an expert, 
accustomed to dealing with severe cases, perceive screening as an opportunity to reduce the incidence of these severe forms, even if this is not necessarily supported by the evidence. 
Furthermore, the epidemiological biases associated with screening (prognostic selection bias, advance bias, overdiagnosis bias) tend to exaggerate the perceived benefits of screening compared to their reality. It has been shown that recent improvements in health are largely attributable to advances in treatment, rather than to screening itself. As this is not necessarily intuitive, it is understandable that clinical experts, who do not always have expertise in critical appraisal of evidence, attribute these advances to the screenings they promote. 
All these factors may explain why experts generally have a favorable preconception of screening. In this sense, I consider that the integration of expert opinions should be used to enrich the reflective process without overriding the evidence. 
Screening and preventive practices can easily be co-opted for political ends, and are the subject of tensions between different interest groups. To ensure that recommendations remain aligned with the highest standards, it is essential that the CTFPHC retains its decision-making autonomy, and that its composition and processes are free from any form of political interference or external pressure. This is essential if it is to retain the trust of clinicians and the public alike. In my opinion, to enable it to play its role to the full, CTFPHC must be given the financial resources and support of our decision-makers.","In my opinion, CTFPHC must remain, and even be recognized, as the key national authority on preventive health, on which other entities can rely to develop public policy and clinical recommendations. In addition, CTFPHC must continue to act as an independent and accessible benchmark for front-line clinicians, ensuring that its recommendations remain free from the exposure and practice biases observed among some specialists. 

To maximize impact, CTFPHC must be supported in establishing formal knowledge-sharing mechanisms to strengthen the consistency of recommendations across the various preventive health players, which should be based on the CTFPHC's work. This is particularly true at provincial level, to ensure that practices are aligned with CTFPHC recommendations. ","To better reflect Canadian diversity and address health equity disparities, CTFPHC should continue to actively engage stakeholders 
equity-seeking communities and experts, while establishing clear guidelines for their contributions. 
It is essential, however, to maintain high standards of evidence for all communities, while avoiding compromising scientific rigor under the guise of equity. I draw the external review committee's attention to a text that details the limited role of screening in reducing health inequities. 
The CTFPHC should, as it has done for breast cancer in racialized women, put forward the evidence while demanding a rigorous level of proof for all communities. In my opinion, it is essential that CTFPHC continues to communicate clearly and transparently about the benefits, risks and uncertainties associated with its recommendations. By highlighting areas of uncertainty, as it already does, CTFPHC can promote informed, shared decision-making, tailored to the specificities of each population. In addition, CTFPHC should continue to call for more studies where there are areas of uncertainty that could be clarified by future research. ",,
N28-04,"I deeply respect the rigour and value of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.  I believe the criticism of this institution is based on misguided approaches many practitioners and academics demonstrate.  The central issue revolves around how patients and the public are engaged with understanding the risks and benefits of potential preventive interventions. To be specific, there is published evidence showing the choices made by the public will differ depending on whether they are informed with relative data or absolute data.  I think the advice regarding using PSA for prostate cancer screening is currently most illustrative.  Between the ages of 50 to 70 those men who are regularly screened with PSA tests will have a 25% reduction in mortality from prostate cancer.  I am aware that different studies cite different percentages, but not enough to change the argument I am about to make.  It is also true that if 1000 men in that age group are unscreened for a decade, there will be 6 deaths from prostate cancer.  If those 1000 men were regularly screened with PSA and the detected cancers were subsequently treated then 4 would still die from prostate cancer.  The relative reduction in this case is 25 to 30% but the absolute reduction is 2 deaths per 1000 men over 10 years.  I can tell you based on speaking to many men in my practice over the last decades that there will be a reduction in how many men choose to undergo regular screening if they are told the absolute risk reduction as well as the relative percentage.  Some will still proceed knowing the reduction is 2/1000.  Men who are told of the side effects, often life long, of screening and treatment are even less likely to undergo screening.  At this point it is important to point out that the information about the absolute side effect data is very important and is even less available to the public.  It is the reduction of screening uptake that alarms or angers some parties.  They have trouble acknowledging this is from more informed, not less informed patients. Colleagues and advocates who wish to reduce the impact of specific diseases such as prostate cancer often adopt a reductionist agenda by attempting to maximize how many public members do the screening procedures.  I think it is disingenuous to consider oneself “patient centered” without taking the measures to give patients and the public clear, absolute presentations of risk and benefit.  There have been movements over the decades to promote literacy with “numbers needed to treat” and “numbers needed to harm”.  Failure of our professions to enthusiastically promote this kind of understanding is a source of mistrust.  At one time I was concurrently the family physician to the UofA Dean of Science, Dean of Medicine and Dean of Nursing.  All 3 of them came to the same conclusion, that the ongoing, even if well intentioned, paternalistic approach of the medical profession would dampen public trust in the health professions.  I think the Canadian Task Force has been one of the few institutions to demonstrate understanding and integrity via these issues.  I apologize for my lengthy email.  It’s currently a bit personal for me.  One of my life long friends is my age, 71.  He asked and received my opinion on prostate screening.  Despite this, he proceeded to screen, and, due to his use of anticoagulants, the discovered prostate cancer was treated with radiation protocol.  He was told that modern technology made side effects very unlikely (no numbers were given).  He now has limited ability to use his legs from radiation neuritis.  He uses twice per day rectal enemas for proven radiation rectal damage and is waiting 2 months to see a urologist for the disabling painful urgency from likely radiation cystitis.  And yet, I read criticisms of the Canadian Task Force and practitioners who simply want patients to better understand the consequences of their choices.  By the way, I fervently hope and trust that better screening and treatments will change the “absolute” data favorably.  I am a firm advocate for much prevention such as bowel cancer screening and think data will likely show we should start sooner.  But the outcomes are entirely different.  I fully understand that there is no perfect policy or approach for every patient.  I am responding to a request for input because we live in a time when all institutions are being attacked and it is unfortunate if a very good one becomes discredited unnecessarily.

N29-01,"KEEP: Rigorous review of evidence without industry conflicts of interest. Independence from lobbying patient groups (with industry funding!), industry, or vested physician/other interest (eg breast cancer radiologists) must not be part of the task force.
CONSIDER: using some aspects from Health Technology Assessment (eg equity, environmental impact, ethical, and economic lenses to help with guidance on recommendations for implementation)","MANDATE: To decide if a screening test should be done at a population level or for a subset of the population, and to clearly convey the harms (including sequelae of over diagnosis, under diagnosis) and benefits in an easy to understand way
COLLABORATE: This is very challenging as most guideline committees (I have sat on a few!) have people sitting on them who have significant industry conflicts of interest; other times, emotional arguments from advocacy groups, rather than science, are heavily influential. So, I’m not sure the task force SHOULD be more collaborative. Maybe they should keep being independent as much as is possible","I don’t know exactly. Obviously broad representation helps. The Task Force cannot afford to pay some of the clinician contributors and I think offering payment for the work would make it more attractive for a more diverse group of people to participate. Right now it likely favours those with academic appointments.
I don’t think the TF must compromise to take in subject matter experts that have concerning financial biases. I would love to see MORE subject matter experts avoid industry entanglement; perhaps if academic and guidelines groups like the Task Force paid something/sufficiently they could attract subject-matter experts that would otherwise work directly with industry",,
N29-02,"I see primarily two groups as the main users of the CTFPHC guidelines:
Frontline providers (family physicians, nurses, etc.). They are the main providers of preventive and screening services.
Members of the public through all the clinical decision support tools developed by the CTFPHC.
The important points to consider, in my opinion, are:
Continue to develop guidelines that consider the reality of frontline practice.
Ensure that guidelines come from a rigorous process of evaluating evidence, including patient values and preferences
Guarantee the active participation of guideline users (family physicians, frontline clinicians, members of the public) in their drafting.
Maintain a rigorous and transparent systematic review process for each recommendation.
Ensure that expert opinions do not replace evidence but enrich the reflective process without being the sole basis.
Continue to rigorously manage conflicts of interest, both financial and intellectual.
Preserve the autonomy of the process, free from political interference or external pressures.
Require the same level of evidence for all communities, including those seeking health equity","I foresee a future mandate for the CTFPHC similar to what is currently in place. I repeat, the CTFPHC is 
a model of scientific rigor. Important points to consider for a mandate include:
Act as the national authority on preventive health guidelines, inspiring other national and international entities.
Remain the reference in preventive health for Canadian frontline practitioners.
Provide relevant tools for the frontline.
Continue to be an independent benchmark for preventive health, both for public policies and 
frontline clinicians.
Maintain the unique representativeness of the frontline, essential for addressing prevention 
and screening issues.
Highlight the gray areas and uncertainties surrounding recommendations.
Implement a plan that integrates equity issues at every stage of guideline development","I feel that the CTFPHC is already performing well in this area. I don't think much more can be done:
Strong representation of frontline actors, starting with family physicians and nurses.
Involvement of patients in the development of guidelines.
Support from various specialist physicians, including those working in public health.
Consultation with other stakeholders (e.g., other medical specialists such as radiologists, 
surgeons, etc.).
Continue discussions with various groups to establish or maintain fruitful collaboration.
In conclusion, the CTFPHC is a vital institution for our healthcare system. It is crucial to continue 
supporting its mandate and rigorous practices to ensure high-quality and equitable preventive 
healthcare for all Canadians. Science has a duty to be impartial and independent.",,
N29-03,"The CTFPHC needs to continue:
focusing on patient-centered outcomes. 
Utilizing
strong primary care provider representation in elaborating guidelines (ensuring their applicability and focus on high value care). It is especially important to have clinicians with whole-patient lens be implicated in developing guidelines for preventative
 care, as individuals cannot be divided into single systems or disease. Specialised medical societies focusing on one single system will bias importance to that system or disease, but individuals are complex. Guidelines for preventative health care should be
focused on health as a whole. 
Focusing tools on shared decision making. This implies transparency and clarity of such tool to present potential benefits but also potential harms allowing a decision to
 be made. 
Implicating experts, from various fields into guideline elaboration,
as free from commercial conflicts of interest as possible. ","The CTFPHC can collaborate in many ways with other societies to develop joint guidelines and make recommendations, while
remaining independent. 
They should never substitute specialized opinion without applying
family care lens 
They should never substitute guidelines from countries with strong private healthcare, without applying
Canadian universal health care lens. 
The CTFPHC can play an important role in developing and sharing guidelines with other countries with universal healthcare systems that place important focus on shared decision making.","The CTFPHC should continue implicating experts and patient partners from diverse fields, ensuring appropriate representativity of guideline-targeted groups in their taskforce.
Often medical literature and RCTs don’t have a good representativity of diversity, recommendations from the CTFPHC should be
transparent about the limitations of recommendation applicability that emerged from their literature review.",,
N29-04,"The Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination has been an incredibly valuable resource for health care providers, funders and administrators since 1979.  Its reviews are extensive and most importantly free of the conflicts of interest in many guideline producing bodies.
The Task Force strength arises from its careful review of the literature and its attention to all published articles on the topics it addresses.  It includes in its analysis guidelines issued by other professional bodies but weighs the degree to which they are compromised by conflicts of interest. Its recommendations may differ from those of other organizations but with carefully considered reasons","On the basis of its performance over the last 45 years, no change in its governance is needed.  The Task Force has been criticized for not bowing to the opinions of some subject matter experts but that reflects its independence from those sources when they show evidence of bias.
The Task Force is already transparent about its membership, methodology and conclusions.  It is accountable to the scientific literature.  The recommendations it makes are already independent which sometimes generates concern from those who wish it aligned with their interests.  It is already scientifically rigorous and timely. Because it takes the time to thoroughly research its recommendations it may not be as agile as other sources but its conclusions are more durable. The Board membership is inclusive by the criteria of gender, ethnic mix and generalist/specialist contributions.","The recommendations of the Task Force are appropriately conservative.  They are criticized by some groups who would like to see them more liberal.  More liberal recommendations may mean more investigations and more treatments but that leads to a conflict of interest for groups that would benefit by less restrictive recommendations. Most criticism comes from some specialist groups, pharmaceutical companies or disease organizations that receive support those groups. 
In conclusion, although some minor changes might improve the Task Force, no major changes are needed. If any improvement were to be made, it would be to increase its funding to enable it to do its research more quickly, to increase the number of topics it covers and to have more funds to disseminate its recommendations with their reasons.",,
N30-01,"The Task Force should structure itself and focus on healthcare challenges with due attention to holistic issues that have great potential for population health improvements. By stacking the Task Force with people trained in mainstream thinking, many important issues get little “air time” by the Task Force. This is a manifestation of a commitment to convention dogma intimately bred through big medicine and big pharma influence, and outdated university and residency training. I offer four examples of priorities, with content representation and Task Force interest lacking","Canada has led the world in developing and researching 24-hour movement guidelines – the
integration of physical activities, sedentary behaviours and sleep across the 24-hour day.
Integration into preventive health is seriously lacking despite great population attributable 
risk associated with very low levels meeting guidelines and unequivocal evidence of the 
importance of having healthy levels of these movement behaviours.
Screen time – especially recreational social media use, is a serious health issue recognized 
by governments around the world (but not Canada). Clinicians are aware of this because of 
the mental, emotional, physical, and social health manifestations that show up in their 
practice routinely – but they are woefully under-prepared to deal with this pervasive and 
progressive issue.
Outdoor time/play is undeniably linked with positive holistic health (social, emotional, 
mental, physical, spiritual) yet is absent in the preventive health universe in Canada. Talk with 
our Indigenous Elders about the centrality of this for individual and population wellbeing. ","Finally, “prevention” should be fundamentally upstream yet the focus of work hovers downstream as I illustrate in the figure below.
While mega-trends in the arrows at top are pushing the population towards illness thresholds and not meeting clinical and public health guidelines, attention is invariably focused on the two arrows furthest to the right, with little to no attention to the arrows on the left, and understanding the correlates, determinants, predictors, antecedents of wellness. The focus is on making the drain bigger rather than turning the tap down – read “ambulance in the valley",,
D02-01,"Frontline physicians need recommendations tailored to first-line patients.
Family doctors and frontline clinicians should play a central role in developing guidelines that apply to their patient population.
Too often, guidelines are influenced by expert opinions or shaped by external pressures (political or media-related). Guidelines should be based on scientific literature and free from any bias.","Guidelines should be developed by frontline clinicians who are experts in their patient populations. The CTFPHC should remain a leader in developing guidelines for frontline practitioners and must ensure its independence from external pressures and expert opinions, to maintain its credibility.
","The CTFPHC must ensure a rigorous, evidence-based process for developing its various guidelines. It is essential to make shared decision-making a central element of these guidelines and to include patients in the thinking process behind the design of these practice guides.",,
D04-01,"1. Clearer Organizational Structure
Formally house the Task Force within a well-defined entity, such as a non-governmental body like the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada or Canadian Medical Association or the Office of the Chief Science Advisor. Guidelines should not be published by the organization housing the Task Force, however.
Streamline Task Force and evidence review to reduce siloed operations between evidence review panels and guideline development. This will allow for easier and more transparent expert oversight of evidence selection and handling.
2. Strengthening Accountability and Inclusivity
Maintain independence from government while ensuring accountability to the medical community and public, perhaps through the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) and the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) as well as patient advocacy groups and public consultation.
Establish a framework for experts to propose revisions or amendments to guidelines based on perceived errors or new landmark evidence.
Fund research to monitor population health outcomes to evaluate guideline impact. 
Vet guidelines through specialists, specialty societies, and primary care providers. This should include an option to perform an evidence-based veto on guidelines seen as dangerous or inappropriate.
Ensure balanced representation by involving both the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) and the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) in guideline development and review. Currently, only CFPC has meaningful involvement.
Acknowledge and work to correct biases and conflicts of interest, such as Task Force members choosing future Task Force members, Task Force paying for evidence review (and thus having the ability to have a strong influence on the evidence review process), CFPC as the sole physician body working with the Task Force, Canadian Medical Association Journal publishing all Task Force guidelines with a publication bias and little or no topic expert guidance in the peer review process.
3. Enhancing Transparency
Replace confidentiality agreements with an open public format (similar to NICE UK) or the Chatham House Rule which encourages transparency by allowing open dialogue while protecting speaker anonymity to build trust and align with scientific principles.
Publish a minority report where there is significant controversy or disagreement within the panel.
Include ethicists in development of new Task Force structure and also at the guideline development level. 
4. Expert-Led Guidelines Development
Topic experts who understand disease nuances and long term sequelae of late diagnosis should lead or co-lead guideline development panels. 
Topic experts should be involved and heeded in the evidence review process. Topic experts are more likely to understand the nuances of good and bad research. This will help avoid the current indiscriminate pooling of good and bad research in the evidence review process.
Recognize that specialty-led guidelines are historically better at anticipating future medical directions than non-expert guidelines. Guidelines are not simply formulaic academic meta-analyses that can be performed by non-experts. They inform practices that impact human lives. 
Avoid overemphasis on conflict of interest (COI) for non-corporate entities, such as physicians. Canadian specialists have long waitlists and are quite unlikely to be motivated to encourage increased inappropriate healthcare utilization. Recognize that even non-topic-experts may have biases and preconceptions. Excluding expertise does not exclude bias. Bias is a relatively small concern in comparison with topic expertise. 
5. Living Guidelines and Regular Updates
Frequently review and update guidelines to maintain relevance.
Work toward a ""living guidelines"" model that evolves with new evidence and medical advancements.
Adopt and adapt successful and safe international guidelines for Canadian needs, with expert endorsement, to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness of guideline development.","1. Adequate Funding
Provide sufficient resources for paid panel involvement, evidence reviews, guideline updates, and responsiveness to emerging research. This is an investment in saved downstream healthcare costs. 
2. Expanded Scope
Include primary prevention strategies, such as guidelines on exercise, nutrition, and smoking cessation, alongside secondary prevention, such as screening.
3.Cost Considerations
Incorporate cost-effectiveness analyses into guideline development. These should include the costs of the intervention/screening as well as the downstream costs and savings associated with earlier disease detection and treatment.
Ensure cost analysis updates are revised promptly after major treatment advances, as flagged by content experts, to reflect modern treatment costs for efficient resource allocation. 
4. National Collaboration
Partner with specialists, primary care providers, patient representatives and public health organizations to harmonize guidelines. Prioritize broad acceptance of guidelines among content experts so as to avoid fragmentation of care and inequities between provinces.
5. International Collaboration
Collaborate with international guideline organizations such as NICE UK, European Commission and WHO while adapting evidence-based models to the Canadian context.
Draw on provincial Clinical Practice Guidelines to ensure national guidelines are harmonized and consider incorporating some of the evidence review work performed by provincial guideline groups. 
Evaluate foreign guidelines for relevance and effectiveness before adoption. Guidelines considered for adoption should be assessed for safety and favourable patient outcomes, keeping in mind that waiting for some outcomes, such as mortality, can take years to assess and surrogates for mortality may be preferable during the interim. 
6. Regular Updates
Embrace the concept of ""living guidelines"" for real-time updates based on landmark new evidence as recommended by content experts.
7. Public Engagement
Promote public awareness through accessible communication and education.
Involve public input to enhance guideline adoption and practicality.","1. Improving Subject-Matter Expert Involvement
Expand Expert Roles: Grant experts leadership roles such as co-chairing responsibility, voting rights and a structured process to ensure their feedback influences decisions and updates.
Enhance Transparency: Allow panel members or consulted experts to withdraw their names or include dissenting views in guidelines in a minority report.
Avoid Selection Bias: Use transparent processes to select diverse, unbiased or minimally biased experts. Where there are unavoidable biases, select members who represent the varying opinions. 
2. Ensuring Diversity in Panels
Representative Panels: Include diverse members to address racial, gender, and socioeconomic disparities. Guideline panels should include significant voting representation from relevant minorities, eg women of colour involved in breast screening guidelines, which may help avoid the current problem of a heavy preference for white-dominant RCT evidence.  
3. Addressing Bias in Evidence
Acknowledge Systemic Bias: Balance reliance on white-predominant RCTs with more diverse observational evidence to counter racial and gender biases. GRADE introduces a systematic form of racism by overwhelmingly favouring RCTs. 
Elevate Diverse Evidence: Recognize racial/socioeconomic differences in disease detection, treatment access and outcomes. Prioritize studies focusing on underrepresented populations where appropriate in order to address these inequities.
4. Engaging Equity-Deserving Communities
Integrate Lived Experiences: Involve representatives from equity-deserving communities to ensure guidelines address their unique needs.
Collaborate with Community Organizations: Partner with groups serving underserved populations for inclusive, accessible recommendations.
5. Establishing Transparent Processes
Feedback Mechanisms: Develop clear frameworks for incorporating expert and stakeholder input following guideline publication in order to gather information on guideline successes and failures. This should help signal the necessity to update guidelines that are failing.
Eliminate NDAs: Transparency necessitates the elimination of confidentiality agreements and NDAs in the development of a publicly funded scientific endeavour. As stated earlier, the Chatham House Rule should suffice to protect the identity of speakers/contributors. NDAs are unlikely to be enforceable but inhibit the involvement of those who feel that they will not be able to object to guidelines or guideline development processes publicly and may therefore suffer damage to their reputations or credibility. This is particularly concerning given the nearly universally poor reception of Task Force guidelines among topic experts. ",,
D05-01,"The broad membership of the Task Force is a strength but must become significantly more inclusive. The restriction of having content experts on the panel is a major limitation of the current process. Guidelines without the input of content experts lack any credibility. The concern that involving content experts leads to bias is misguided and can be easily mitigated. All panel members should be required to acknowledge conflicts of interest. Specific to prostate cancer the concern among non-experts that early detection leads to over-treatment is entirely false and fails to incorporate the experience of experts and the realworld clinical experience of active surveillance and disease risk stratification that only those who practice in the space can provide. The currently approved Prostate Cancer Screening guideline lacks specialist input and has led to the dissemination of misinformation amongst primary care providers and caused significant harm to patients due to delayed diagnoses. 
The current Task Force membership structure must be further expanded to include members-at-large or content experts who are brought on when a specific guideline is being considered for development. Ideally, the content expert should serve in a co-chair capacity. 
Furthermore, the core membership of the Task Force including the Chair, must include well-defined terms of office. Appropriate administrative support must be built into the group’s terms of reference and not be reliant on individual member’s institution to subsidize this activity.
Ideally the Task Force should operate independent of government, while ensuring credibility and accountability to the general public. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) may be an appropriate body for oversight of the Task Force’s mandate, however political interference must not be permitted. National organizations such as the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada or the College of Family Physicians of Canada are two potential sponsoring bodies that could also be considered, and do not have direct political affiliations.
The current Task Force guideline process seems to overemphasize the utility of the highest level of evidence-based literature and the GRADE methodology in its development process. When randomized clinical trials have been published that are methodologically sound and reflective of contemporary clinical practice, this material deservedly should be incorporated into guideline recommendations. On the other hand, not all clinically important questions can be interrogated this way and lower levels of evidence such as large cohort studies can be equally informative. Moreover, marginalized populations are often underrepresented in 
randomized clinical trials, affecting the applicability of the findings. Again, the input from clinical experts in the space can be helpful in navigating the evidence to ensure clinically meaningful and valid data is being considered in the guideline writing process. 
Finally, to develop guidelines that are truly useful to Canadians, the Task Force needs to be adequately funded. Proper funding to develop comprehensive, regularly monitored and timely updated guidelines is an investment in downstream health care costs.","The mandate of the Task Force of the future should be to develop clinical 
practice guidelines incorporating evidence-based data with real-world expertise 
and the experiences of health care workers directly involved in patient care. 
Published guidelines should be considered living documents and the mandate of 
the Task Force should also include updating guidelines whenever new significant 
data becomes known, rather than waiting for a rigid 5–10-year interval before 
considering revisions. Ideally, the Task Force should monitor other national and 
international guideline development organizations for new guidelines that can 
be reviewed to be sure Canadian guidelines remain congruent with others. It is 
critical that Canadian guidelines are harmonized in their messaging to prevent 
confusion amongst clinicians and patients.
To ensure guidelines truly meet the health care needs of Canadians, the scope of 
the guideline topics should be expanded to cover primary disease prevention 
such as healthy eating, importance of physical exercise, safe alcohol use and 
smoking cessation. 
In addition, the guideline development process should incorporate costeffectiveness analyses to include the costs of the intervention/screening as well 
as the downstream costs and savings associated with earlier disease detection 
and treatment. This data exists for many disease entities and must be included to 
provide a balanced view of health care costs. Cost analysis updates must be 
regularly provided and revised promptly after major treatment advances, as 
identified by content experts, to reflect the most up-to-date treatment costs for 
efficient resource allocation.","As repeatedly stated, subject matter experts must be members of the guideline development process, not just as invited reviewers of a completed guideline. The Task Force should work with national medical specialty associations to identify key knowledge experts in a particular field. The selection of a guideline development panel should be transparent and reflect diversity, equity, and inclusion principles as well as regional representation whenever possible. Patient representation on panels should also be considered especially including 
underrepresented minorities to be sure all patient perspectives are being heard.
In addition, partnering with social organizations that support underserved populations and patient advocacy groups may help to identify subjects worthy of guideline development.
In closing, the Canadian Urological Association envisions a future Task Force that is more inclusive in its membership, more transparent in its actions, takes a wider panoramic view of clinical practice guideline development and implementation, and is agile at responding to an era where scientific data is changing rapidly. We foresee the potential to make the Canadian Task Force a truly useful source of 
information for clinicians and patients and an international leader in clinical practice guideline scholarship.",,
D05-02,"Governance – leadership. First and foremost, the overall Task Force (TF) methods should be maintained since they are second to none with respect to rigour and transparency (see figure below). The TF is recognized nationally and internationally for their leadership, particularly in areas of incorporating values and preferences, as well as harms and benefits, to create state of the art clinical preventive guidelines. 
Providing guidance for primary care providers should remain the mandate as it has been since the inception of the TF. The experience and perspectives of specialists differ.  The former aims to maximize the health of each individual in a holistic manner while the latter seek to minimize the illness from a single disease. Both are important to patients and the health care system; recognizing the difference in approach helps to understand why some specialist groups have difficulty with the recommendations of the TF and tend to minimize the impact of harms relative to benefits. Keeping the focus on primary care, with additional recognition of other affected groups/organizations (e.g., public health, cancer screening programs, etc.,), helps understand the potential for conflict with specialist groups and single disease advocates. Other groups in Canada such as Choosing wisely (focus on de-prescribing) and Alberta’s PEER group (focus on medical therapies) complement the TF but have less rigorous methods and address less complex topics (such as screening). 
Maintain the evidence review of effectiveness, including both benefits and harms, and translating the knowledge into tools that can be used by clinicians with their patients. The TF should maintain its international leadership in examining systematically (via evidence reviews) patient values and preferences. With additional funding, it would be good to expand knowledge translation tools for the public and patients given the primary care crisis in Canada.
Changes to governance/leadership include creating a permanent administrative home for the TF to reduce the administrative burden on the TF leadership and allow consistency of policies and procedures that currently differ between host-universities. Also, a chief operating officer (or similar title) should be funded from additional TF moneys to remove the administrative burden from the Chair, Vice-Chair, members and contributors. This would improve timeliness since the TF leadership could focus more exclusively on guideline development. Keeping the current structure of the TF members, independent ERSCs, contracts for KT and PHAC-based science team members is preferred. Consider adding communications personnel and perhaps a methodologist/researcher (e.g., to keep current and innovate guideline development with progress in AI and ) directly to a TF secretariate
Leadership: Primary care leadership/membership should be maintained since the mandate is appropriately directed to them. The current recruitment process is strong with respect to its criteria, yet would benefit from more outreach and involvement with primary care Colleges/universities. This could be managed by the COO position mentioned above, facilitated by TF members. The TF has become increasingly diverse over the past years and this should be continued and expanded. In addition, representation from varied practice types, across Canada, would be helpful although mandating membership from individual provinces/territories would be problematic if no primary care clinicians/methodologists are interested in this volunteer role. At one time, there was a concern of too many “academic” clinicians and that these members likely would experience a more resourced practice than most clinicians in Canada. Ensuring community-based primary care involvement, through compensation/honoraria, would help limit the financial burden of TF work. It is uncertain how compensation would affect membership, especially for diverse communities. Lack of compensation is a known key barrier to TF membership, particularly among rural providers. Continuing two 4-year member terms is except when the usual work of the TF is disrupted (e.g., pandemic, expedite breast cancer update, EER) and does not allow for the normal learning curve progression. 
Consider having the core TF as similarly structured, but bringing on additional “adjunct” primary care clinicians for different work groups. These could be voting adjunct members and would require conflicts of interest (COIs) to be negligible, or at least manageable. This would spread the work of the TF and potentially allow wider involvement, inclusiveness and timeliness
Accountability:  Regular evaluations such as the one done in 2022 and the current EER, as well as PHAC oversight provide accountability. Unfortunately, with the release of evidence-based recommendations that do not support some groups’ preferences, we are witness to the result: political responses (public berating, one-sided parliamentary committee studies, another review of the TF, ministerial pressure to come to consensus) and media vilification. If the TF is not independent, then it would be subject to political interference, pressure/intimidation and populism, rather than evidence.
Independence: It is necessary that the TF remains independent and evidence-based. Unfortunately, even though the TF is currently supposed to be independent, it has experienced interference from pressure groups and resultant political demands (e.g., expedition of the breast cancer screening recommendations). Never before has this occurred to the TF, and its structure and function does not enable a robust media, political or advocacy-like response. With the release of evidence-based recommendations that do not support some groups’ preferences, we are witness to the result: political responses (public berating, one-sided parliamentary committee studies, another review/evaluation of the TF, ministerial pressure to come to consensus with the pressure groups) and media vilification. The historical division between politics and guideline development should be re-established. If the TF is not independent, then it would be subject to further political interference, pressure/intimidation and populism, rather than evidence.
To enable more rapid guideline development, please consider the following:
•	Structural-timeliness/rigour: Continue with the science team employed by PHAC but increase the number and ensure science staff are dedicated to TF work such that they are not pulled to do other things in PHAC. Although having a dedicated TF scientific team would be useful, the benefits of being within PHAC are numerous for individuals (administrative support, language training, benefits, career opportunities) and the TF (e.g., networking with other governmental groups such as Statistics Canada). An example of the problem of having inadequate/dedicated science team, is the inability to advance the TF’s re-affirmation procedure to improve guideline timeliness. Approximately nine guidelines went through the process in 2022 with most recommended for re-affirmation. Unfortunately, there was/is insufficient science staff to complete the process, and they have had to rely on student placements (who have fortunately been quite skilled). As a result, only one older guideline has been officially reaffirmed.
•	Structure: Funding and training for computer-assisted guideline development programs (e.g., GRADE-Pro) and use of AI. GRADE-Pro is planned to be piloted with an upcoming guideline, but greater computer-assisted tools would help to complete more routine tasks. Consider adding additional funding to allow for “real-time” and/or “rapid reviews” for existing guidelines to expedite the reaffirmation/sunset/full update process.
•	Governance/Leadership-timeliness, agility: Compensate TF members (that are not salaried) so that they can carve out the necessary time and not be negatively impacted financially. An example of funding from PHAC that could be examined is the Canadian Guidelines for Post-COVID-19 Condition. Compensation was discussed in the 2022 review as eloquently stated, “The lack of compensation for members affects the Task Force's ability to recruit new members. Without such compensation, some health care professionals such as rural and remote physicians are unable to participate. The lack of compensation has also limited the amount of time that members can devote to Task Force activities, affecting overall timeliness.”
Structure-transparency, rigour:  Maintain and continue the TF’s work towards transparency, including publication of all key documents, stakeholder/interest holder comments and responses, as well as the Evidence to Decision Framework. This effort should be continued to include all that could influence the TF and its development (e.g., interest holders, clinical experts, patient partners, etc.,). All clinical experts and patient partners should continue to be identified in the recommendation, whether they agreed or not with the recommendation, for transparency. Codify that meetings between the TF and other groups (e.g., medical societies, colleges) should have a public agenda and minutes to prevent unrecognized lobbying/advocacy on guideline topics. 
Increase transparency on guideline topic selection and progress. An example is the TF’s recent posting of guidelines that are in progress and the stage of development – topics under examination had not been public before until after the protocols were published. 
Structure- inclusiveness: Diversification was identified in the 2022 Evaluation with one of the following recommendation: “Examine potential compensation for Task Force members, which may help to diversify its current composition.” Although the compensation issue was declined by PHAC, efforts have been made to enhance diversification and inclusiveness. This is ongoing and includes involvement of diverse patient/public participation (e.g., TF-Public Advisors Network). For an example on inclusivity, a TF Fellow and members with specific expertise in this area as well as the Knowledge Translation Team have provided input to several developing guidelines to ensure more inclusive language expertise is used. Following the release of the Equity in Guideline systematic review (which included TF members), the TF was developing an equity plan. The draft plan included a review of all methods and was to be finalized with the TF and incorporated into the methods manual. Unfortunately, Science Team staff and the TF were pulled to other priorities and this remains pending. Resources to obtain input, interest holder consultation and finalization of the plan so that it can be actioned would be helpful.  
Expansion of stakeholders/interest holders to specifically support diversity across guidelines could be beneficial. ","The mandate of the TF should remain “to develop clinical practice guidelines that support primary care providers in delivering preventive health care.” There is no other group that does this in Canada. As above, the nature of the primary care differs from specialist care, especially given the often decades long relationship between providers and patients/clients. Most often primary care includes family doctors/GPs, nurse practitioners, and nurses, but is also open to include a wide-variety of more specialized care as offered by mid-wives, obstetricians, pediatricians, therapists, etc. Primary care providers see the breadth and depth of health and illness and deserve guidelines that represent their practices with relative consistency and rigorous methods across topics. As is currently done, the TF’s mandate focuses on preventive health care at an individual clinician-patient/client level to promote personalized care that is sensitive care to the individual and their reality. “Organized” population-based prevention focuses on broad health promotion/disease prevention activities that is helpful, but cannot substitute for individualized care. Even online “risk prediction” tools, which aim to personalize care, are rarely validated with respect to patient-important o
While understanding that millions of Canadians do not have a primary care provider, this is not a reason to change the mandate of the TF. The solution to the primary care crisis will ot flow from a change in the TF mandate. If anything, the results of the TF guidelines help primary care providers to focus on what works, the tools to engage for shared decision-making and what not to do. 
The main barrier for more collaboration with other guideline development internationally is time given the current volunteer nature of the TF membership. The TF does liaise with USPSTF, the UK and other groups, and are active in the Guideline International Network (GIN) but it can be episodic on both sides. The exception is for review of guideline recommendations, where wide consultation/input is sought. For national guideline developers in particular, it is important to ensure COIs are managed to allow unbiased expertise is shared. For example, clinical experts who worked on Osteoporosis Canada’s guidelines were also intentionally part of the TF’s working group on fragility fractures to promote cross-fertilization. This preserved the integrity of the TF’s processes so that it would not be seen as an osteoporosis advocacy group, nor be influenced by industry or other COIs (e.g., bone density clinics). It should be distinguished (and as noted above) that the TF bases its decisions on evidence, and shouldn’t be influenced by advocacy, pressure groups, political interference, individuals with important COIs or the “loudest voice”. Hence collaboration with other national groups must be in line with the TF methods. To date, the least conflicted Canadian guideline group appears to be Alberta’s PEER, which the TF has worked with frequently (e.g., a former TF member is in a leadership role with PEER). ","The Task Force engages interest holders at many different points including from topic selection, feedback on systematic reviews and guidelines (including associated disposition tables), peer review for systematic reviews and guidelines (again with disposition tables), patient partners and subject matter experts (SMEs) contribution to guideline working groups, engagement in webinars, TF-Public Advisory Panel, consultation on guideline implementation, user testing and more. In particular, seeking input from equity-deserving communities and other groups has been part of interest holder outreach but could be broadened. As noted above, completing the draft, consulting on and finalizing the TF’s Equity Plan would codify the results of the systematic review into TF methods. This would ensure equity principles are considered throughout the TF and guideline methods. In addition to enacting the Equity Plan, a more formalized approach to the assessment of “Equity” as one of the GRADE domains would be beneficial. Leveraging the work of the EER to identify additional interest holders and individuals to provide input would be valuable. 
Other possibilities could be to consider developing “round table” equity-deserving groups (or similar) to consult specifically with the TF as guidelines are developed. Again, COI management is important as is ensuring the TF remains evidence-based. Identifying evidence gaps, language, and systematic issues and barriers/enablers to guideline implementation would strengthen the TF’s recommendations. ",,
