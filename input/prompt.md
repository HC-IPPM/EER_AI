The External Expert Review (EER) of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Task Force) will be launching an open consultation to invite written submissions from interest holders. This consultation was requested by the Review Panel in response to the level of interest that the EER has received following its launch on October 9, 2024.

This initiative forms part of the EER’s evidence gathering phase and is intended to ensure a comprehensive review. Given the EER’s limited timeframe culminating in the development of a final report with actionable recommendations by March 2025, this was deemed by the members to be the best option to engage with interest holders, as opposed to inviting verbal presentations during meetings. The consultation period will be open for one month –  ideally between November 18 and December 18, 2024.  Closing on December 18 will allow for the Secretariat to synthesize and analyze the submissions, and send the information to members in advance of the next meting of the EER, currently scheduled for the week of January 27.  

To help structure and focus written submissions, interest holders will be invited to provide insights in response to the following three questions:

 - Which practices should be maintained or what changes to the Task Force governance or structure could further support transparency, accountability, independence and leadership, towards rigorous, timely, agile and inclusive guidelines?

 - Considering the broader preventive health care landscape, what should be the mandate of the Task Force of the future and how can it collaborate with other entities involved in guideline development nationally and internationally?
 
 - How can the Task Force strengthen interest holder engagement including with subject-matter experts, equity-deserving communities and other groups to address health equity disparities and reflect Canadian diversity in guideline development and implementation?
